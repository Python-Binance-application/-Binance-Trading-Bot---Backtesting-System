BACKTESTING & TRADING DISCLAIMER:

This backtesting software is provided for educational, research, and analytical 
purposes only. It is designed to test trading strategies on historical data and 
should not be considered as financial advice or a guarantee of future performance.

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:

1. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS
   Backtesting results are based on historical data and may not reflect actual 
   trading conditions, market volatility, or future price movements.

2. BACKTESTING LIMITATIONS
   - Does not account for slippage in all market conditions
   - May not reflect liquidity constraints during extreme market events
   - Assumes instant order execution at desired prices
   - Does not simulate partial fills or rejected orders
   - Market conditions change and historical patterns may not repeat

3. OVERFITTING RISK
   Optimizing parameters on historical data may lead to overfitting, where the 
   strategy performs well on past data but poorly in live trading.

4. FORWARD TESTING REQUIRED
   Always conduct forward testing (paper trading) before deploying any strategy 
   with real capital. Monitor performance closely for significant divergence 
   from backtested results.

5. RISK MANAGEMENT
   - Only trade with capital you can afford to lose
   - Cryptocurrency trading involves substantial risk of loss
   - Margin trading amplifies both gains and losses
   - Always use appropriate position sizing and stop losses

6. NO FINANCIAL ADVICE
   The authors and contributors are not licensed financial advisors. This 
   software does not constitute investment advice, trading recommendations, 
   or solicitation to buy or sell any financial instruments.

7. USER RESPONSIBILITY
   By using this backtesting software, you acknowledge that:
   - You are solely responsible for your trading decisions
   - You understand the limitations of backtesting
   - You will conduct proper due diligence before live trading
   - You will not hold the authors liable for any trading losses
   - You comply with all applicable laws and regulations

8. DATA ACCURACY
   While efforts are made to ensure data accuracy, the authors cannot guarantee 
   the completeness, accuracy, or timeliness of historical data obtained from 
   third-party sources.

9. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
   Users are responsible for ensuring their use of this software complies with 
   all applicable financial regulations, securities laws, and trading rules in 
   their jurisdiction.

10. TESTING REQUIREMENT
    Never deploy a strategy to live trading based solely on backtest results. 
    Always conduct extensive paper trading and forward testing with small 
    amounts before scaling up.

The authors, contributors, and distributors of this software expressly disclaim 
all liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive 
damages arising from the use or misuse of this backtesting software, including 
but not limited to financial losses, missed opportunities, or system errors.

USE THIS SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
